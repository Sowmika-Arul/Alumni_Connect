## Problem Statement
- The Government Engineering College struggles to maintain alumni engagement, secure donations, and offer services like networking and job opportunities. 
- Alumni lack a unified platform to stay connected, limiting mentorship, collaboration, and support. 
- A comprehensive Alumni Association platform across web application is needed to address these gaps and strengthen alumni relationships.

## Proposed Solution
-  **Alumni Registration**: User-friendly login processes on both web and mobile platforms, allowing alumni to join the association, update their profiles, and stay connected with peers and the institution.

- **Donation Portal**: Secure mechanisms on both platforms for alumni to contribute donations easily and support various initiatives and projects undertaken by the college, fostering a culture of philanthropy.

- **Networking Hub**: Dedicated sections on both platforms to connect alumni based on shared interests, professions, and geographic locations, facilitating professional networking, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities. 

- **Job Portal**: Integrated job search and posting features accessible via web and mobile apps, enabling alumni to explore career opportunities, post job openings, and connect with potential employers within the alumni network.
